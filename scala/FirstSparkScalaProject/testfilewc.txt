here's the settings to change the scala compiler

    right click on your project -> choose "properties"
    from the menu tree on the left select 'Scala compiler'
    check "use project settings" if unchecked
    select the appropriate Scala installation from the 'Scala Installation' drop down
    close the project properties window
    rebuild project

my personal peeve is that when I run the eclipse plugin command from sbt, it always resets the scala installation for my project to " Latest 2.12 bundle (dynamic)" so I've gotten pretty use to manually resetting my scala compiler version (along with my build path source directories).

If you need to (re)set your scala library container you can also do this in the project properties window (via the "Java Build Path" -> Libraries section). You may need to do this if you don't have an explicit fixed 2.12.1 installation available as an option in the above drop down.
